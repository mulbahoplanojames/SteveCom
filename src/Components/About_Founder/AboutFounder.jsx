const text1 = `KOLLILA, Bong County-Amidst growing concerns of food insecurity in Africa and the looming global famine, a Liberian statesman and CEO of the Naa-Kaai-Kai enterprise, Hon. Edward Karfiah emerges as a visionary leader with a profound plan to ensure long-term food security in Liberia. This article delves into his comprehensive approach, which goes beyond short-term relief efforts and emphasizes sustainable solutions in keeping with a design of innovative strategies.`;

const text2 = `The former Bong County District #5 lawmaker has  not only engaged local communities, but is also promoting agribusiness investments, improving infrastructure for agricultural development, and empowering local farmers through training and access to resources. Through Mr. Karfiah exceptional leadership, Liberia offers a compelling case study for other nations grappling with similar challenges.`;

const text3 = `Making a presentation recently on the topic “Good agricultural practices for sustainable cashew production in Liberia” in Kollila, Yelequelleh District, Bong County, Hon. Karfiah informed the farmers that due to cashew’s high nutritional value and increasing affordability by the consumers, demand for cashew fruits and nuts continue to increase in foreign countries except Liberia where the crop has no value.`;

const text4 = `“Cashews are valued for their high nutritive content, making them popular among health-conscious consumers. This demand is reflected in both domestic and international markets, contributing to the economic viability of cashew farming, especially in seven countries in the sub region,” Hon. Karfiah, lead facilitator told the participants.`;

const text5 = `The initiative comes at a backdrop of helping to lift people out of poverty, which to a larger extent cannot be divorced from food insecurity, while the Government of Liberia spends a staggering amount of US$200 million annually on rice importation alone.`;
const text6 = `The training brought together members and leaders of community-based organizations, including   smallholder farmers’ organizations, women organizations, youth, and owners of small-scale businesses in the county. `;

const text7 = `The training which is a wakeup call to farmers and the government, the former Bong County lawmaker added that before anyone can invest in the sector, it is important to understand the economic importance of cashew production in national development. “It also calls for understanding the management and practices, and the role the crop plays in rural development, as well as its contribution to global trade.”  `;

const text8 = `To make the situation worse for Liberia, Mr. Karfiah divulged that though there is a wide gap between potential productivity and present production, the land tenure system which is hindering production in the agriculture sector, some of the major factors that affect cashew farming in Liberia are lack of farming knowledge, and the lack of data on the crop.`;

const text9 = `Cashew has several nutritional value and huge market demand from the sub regional to international markets. The crop is a lucrative business, with estimated returns ranging between 30 to 40 percent within 3-5 years of cultivation. Also, the crop’s margin of profit is significant, making cashew farming a major source of income for many households and enterprises. Cote d’Ivoire is among the highest cashew grown countries in the sub region.`;

const text10 = ` Co-facilitated by Alex Dortie Kolleh, a research officer in the Natural Resource Management Program at the Central Agricultural Research Institute (CARI), delved through the process from land preparation, sowing, pest management, harvest, and post-harvest.
According to Mr. Kolleh, to cultivate the crop begins with placing the seeds on nursery, prepare the potting mixture in the proportion of 1:1:1 (red soil; coarse river sand: compost) in heavy rainfall areas and 1:1 (red soil: compost) in low rainfall areas. “Rock phosphate at 5g/kg of potting mixture may also be added for getting good root growth of seedlings.”`;

const text11 = `Mr. Kolleh, who is also from the soil unit at CARI, added that in heavy rainfall areas, 30-40 drainage holes of 0.5 cm diameter may be punched uniformly on the polythene bags. In low rainfall areas, the number of drainage holes can be few. The filled bags should be arranged in beds of 1000 number each (100x10).`;

const text12 = `He continued: “To sow the seeds, the cashew has to be soaked in water for 12-24 hours before it is dibbled in the center of the polythene bags, stalk-end upwards and covered with little soil.”`;

const text13 = `During rainy days, Mr. Kolleh asserted that if water stagnation is observed, excess water should be removed by pressing the sides of bags, and during dry months, the seedbeds may be mulched with paddy straw till the germination takes place. The seeds will germinate 10-15 days after sowing depending on the weather condition.`;

const text14 = `“A large number of insect and pests have been reported in cashew but tea mosquito bug and cashew stem and root borer are the major pests of cashew.  The tea mosquito bug (TMB), Helopeltis antonii is the most serious foliage and fruit pest of cashew in the world. `;

const text15 = `Integrated pest management involving resistance and adopting spraying of insecticide is a good package to manage TMB.  As the TMB incidence coincides with critical period of flushing, flowering and fruit set, need based spray as given below has been recommended. `;

const text16 = `The main harvesting season is from February to May. Most farmers harvest their crop before they drop to prevent damage. This very often results in poor quality of the kernels. The optimum stage of harvest is when nuts drop to the ground.`;

const text17 = `High quality nuts are obtained when freshly fallen nuts are separated from the cashew apples and sun dried for two-three days to bring down the moisture percentage from about 25 per cent to below nine percent.
Cashew is a native of southeast Brazil. Portuguese missionaries took it to east Africa and India during the 5th century where it became abundant at low altitudes near the seacoast. The tree produces wood that is used in local economies for such practical items as shipping crates, boat, charcoal, as well as gum that is similar to gum Arabic. The resin with the shell of fruit is used as an insecticide, and in the production of plastics.`;

const text18 = `It is also important in traditional medicines. The cashew apple is used locally in beverages, jams, and jellies, though most cultivation is directed toward production of the valuable seed crop/`;
